## Troubleshooting

**Port already in use?**
```
python run.py
# If port 5000 is busy, edit run.py and change port=5000 to port=5001
```

**Database reset (fresh start)?**
```
# Delete pscrm.db and run again — it auto-recreates with seed data
del pscrm.db        (Windows)
rm pscrm.db         (Mac/Linux)
python run.py
```

**Image uploads not working?**
Make sure the `static/uploads/` folder exists. It's auto-created by `run.py`.

**Module not found?**
```
pip install flask werkzeug
```
